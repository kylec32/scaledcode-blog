# About Me

My name is Kyle Carter and I am a prinicpal software engineer that works on a quality management system by day. I have a passion for software
and software architecture. I aim to share my experiences in an effort to help others in the industry as well as learn myself. One of the things
I love the most about software is the ability (the requirement even) to constantly be learning.
