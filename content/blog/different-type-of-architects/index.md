Software architecture can be a hard thing to pin down. While at times architecture may feel intimidating, anyone writing any code is participating in software architecture. From simple scripts to sprawling distributed systems there is always a software architecture whether planned or not. While every person that writes code participates in architecture, there are some that have the distinct role of shepherding the software architecture of a system. Depending on what kind of system you are working on and the business structure that surrounds it there can be different types of software architects you will encounter.

### The Accidental Architect

Either because someone doesn't have the distinct role of architect or because there is a need for this person they knowingly or unknowingly step up. The people that end up as accidental architects weren't looking to take this step in their career but it just happened to them. The benefit that can come out of this is humility in being asked to fill this role which is, unfortunately, sometimes missing with many non-accidental architects. While almost certainly not trained or experienced in leading architecture, accidental architects can still be successful in steering an application's development. Those that find themselves in this situation would be well served in educating themselves in software architecture in order to level up their skills in this new arena that they are having to deal with.

### The Wannabe Architect

While at times they may feel like the accidental architect they instead strive for the role, even when they shouldn't/weren't asked to fulfill this role. These people can often end up coming out after diving into software architecture and determining that they should try out all the new things. This attempt to push the organization/system in a direction is often merely for the sake of technology and not to solve an actual issue the system is trying to solve. While this is a trap that any developer/architect can fall into, what makes an accidental architect especially dangerous is that they are trying to push the whole organization in this dangerous direction without any authority and without proper responsibility either.

### The Ivory Tower Architect

Of all the types of architects referenced in this post I believe this is the most discussed one. The ivory tower (sometimes referred to as the *astronaut architect*) is an architect that is extremely disconnected from the day-to-day working of the system and how it is developed. This may be due to atrophy of skills, general disinterest in understanding the system, or even general incompetence. The most common case in my experience is a senior engineer who steps into an architect role, becomes overly invested in the high-level architect duties and responsibilities, and lets themselves become disconnected from reality and thus more focused on talking about the theoretical with no respect for the actual. I have unfortunately dealt with more people that fit this description than I care to admit.

An interesting case where I saw this highlighted in an extremely condensed way was when I went to [O'Reilly's Software Architecture Conference](https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/software-architecture.html) (which has unfortunately been canceled going forward). This conference's attendees were almost exclusively people with "software architect" somewhere in their title. I had the opportunity to participate in a case study exercise led by [Neal Ford](https://nealford.com/). Groups were created with 5â€“8 people each and each was given a description of a system to build and, after a 45 minutes prep period, each group was to present the high-level architecture that they came up with to Neal and other judges. Immediately my group's discussion turned into a listing of every hot technology of the day. You would have thought we were getting paid by how many popular technologies we could use at one time. It felt wrong but at the time I couldn't put my finger on why. Only during the judging did it become abundantly clear. Neal and the other judges, after hearing our high-level architecture, ripped our design to shreds based on our focus on the technologies used more than on the business problem to be solved. Some of the technologies literally couldn't even be used in parts of our problem domain. What was the winning solution? It was a group that had read through their problem brief closely, pulled out the biggest problem to be solved, and spent all their time trying to architect a solution around that. It was far from a complete solution to the whole problem but they had understood the issues they were up against and had decided to spend their time on what would make the biggest impact. That team had shrugged off the pull to be ivory architects and stayed connected.

### The Invisible Architect

The invisible architect is one that will often sit more in the shadows as far as the organization is concerned. It is even possible he/she will be looked at as possibly not pulling their weight by those high in the organization and disconnected from the day-to-day actions of the development team. However, this architect is actually extremely connected and valuable to the organization. This architect is constantly connected to the development team, is looking forward to what is coming next, and is preparing to enable the development team for tackling that work. This preparation may take the form of proofs-of-concept, preparing tooling, techniques, training, and/or mentoring for the development teams. In doing all of this and focusing on enabling others to do the work the invisible architect stays out of the critical path accelerating what the business is capable of outputting. While there are downsides to the invisible architecture style, such as the architect not getting the recognition they may deserve, I am a fan of this style. It truly makes the architect a force multiplier and an asset.

Each software architect's style has its strengths and weaknesses. Some of them weigh more heavily on the negative side than the positive one but all exist for a reason. If you are given the opportunity to act in a software architect capacity take notice of which style you naturally lean toward. Consider if that is what the system needs and the shortcomings of your style and what compensation you can come up with for its shortcomings. If, conversely, you find yourself working with an architect it can be useful to identify their style. This can help identify their strengths and focus on and magnify those strengths while helping them avoid their weaker areas.
