Being a software engineer presents a great opportunity in the current job market. There is a great need for software professionals which creates many opportunities for software engineers. At the same time, many motivated and passionate individuals work in the field. Given this, how does one stand out from others and fast track their growth as a software professional? Let us dig into a few ideas.

### Volunteer to dig into something

At one of my early professional programming jobs, we had several guilds (sometimes called "communities of practice") where like-minded people gathered to share and discuss topics (inspired by the [Spotify guild concept](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2020/3/243029-spotify-guilds/abstract)). There were UI/UX, architecture, security, and data guilds. I started attending the architecture guild and one day the idea came up to investigate a tool to see if it would be useful for us. I was the most junior in the room but decided to volunteer. The tool was a play on parts of the [Spring framework](https://spring.io/) but implemented in the language we were using for our product. I went and dug into the tool, tried implementing it in a part of our application, and put together a report (I wish I could find that report today, I am sure it was poorly put together). I returned the next week and presented the tool and everyone agreed it was not the tool for us.

It would initially seem like nothing good came of this experience but a few years later that same organization was investigating building some products with Java and looking into using Spring. Given my previous research, I quickly applied my learning from before and became an expert in Spring for the organization. On top of being able to use the knowledge later, my volunteering also helped set me apart from my peers. This willingness to volunteer and dig into hard things was part of how I ended up on the software architecture team when it was created at that organization.

### Get domain knowledge
All software is built to solve a problem (at least you hope so). All successful software companies have found a problem to solve in the world and applied code to solve that problem. Given this, find times to poke your head out of the code and understand the lives of those that use your software. What do they like about your software? What do they like about their job? What do they hate about their job? Why is their job important? If you build financial software learn about finance. Maybe you build project management software, try managing a project in your own life with your company's software and, if possible, your competitor's software.

Many software engineers simply learn the bare minimum about a domain to get by. To be perfectly honest, this is a viable way to go about things. However, if you choose this your career will move much more slowly and you will find yourself bumping into ceilings that you can't get past without investing in building your domain knowledge. When you meet those that know how to speak just as comfortably about an algorithm as about some domain problem you see the great leverage they have in their scope of influence to affect great progress.

### Look Up From Your Work

It is easy to simply focus on the issue at hand in your day-to-day work. You pull a story off the backlog, read the acceptance criteria, implement the feature, ship it, and then move on to the next story. This is generally a good thing. At face value, this is what you were hired to do. However, there is value in looking up from your work from time to time. How does your work fit into your company's vision? How does this solve the problem at hand? Is there a problem out there that you are solving or are you writing software for software's sake? This can be a balancing act because there may be people at your organization that have these questions core to their job role so you don't want to step on those toes. Understanding if your work is solving a real problem and in what way can raise you from simply a technical leader to much more.

### Code review others.

Hopefully early in your career you have the opportunity to have senior engineers reviewing your code. I know for the first while having someone else critique my code in this way was extremely uncomfortable. Thankfully I had a great senior engineer that didn't get offended by my defensiveness which helped me let down my guard and I learned a lot from her. This is not all though, don't let the code reviewing end with just reviewing your code. Review other people's code as well. Maybe you are not in a spot early in your career where your sign-off matters to the release of the code but review it anyway. If at the beginning you don't feel comfortable offering critiques don't do that at the beginning (however if you are comfortable go for it!) Feel free to ask questions in the code review though. "Why did you implement it this way?" "How does this handle the X business case?" etc. Look up APIs and code patterns that you don't recognize. Reading and understanding lots of code can do wonders for your development. Early in my career, I was put in a position where I would review a lot of people's code. This was hugely influential for me and skyrocketed my growth. Later people would be impressed with my knowledge in particular areas. It wasn't because I was particularly smart, it was simply because I had seen that code, pattern, API, etc. before.

### Learn the principles

Technology moves extremely fast. What was the hip trend last year could all of a sudden become an anti-pattern today. Because of this, it is critical to set a solid foundation. When there is a new technology that is becoming popular seek to understand what core principles it helps achieve. Does it help with coupling, does it simplify code, does it help with parallel processing, etc? By understanding the importance of these core principles not only will you be better equipped to critique new technologies, but you will also be setting your core skillset in a more solid foundation.

### Be willing to try something new (including a new job)

A common theme across these suggestions has been the idea of change. Change of course is a constant in the software industry. Even so, sometimes it is time for us to introduce change for ourselves. Maybe this means taking on a new project (which can fit well within the "Volunteer to dig into something" suggestion), while at other times this may mean moving to a different job. We often hear that moving jobs is the most surefire way to increase your salary. That said, growing your career doesn't necessarily mean having a bigger and bigger salary, sometimes it means taking a step back as far as salary is concerned and taking on a new environment.

### Be willing to stick it out

Here is the counterpoint to the previous suggestion. There is a lot to be learned from sticking through a project from start to finish and possibly even to the point of obsoleteness. Too many times we see people come into an organization, make a bunch of changes, and then leave before the system has lived its life. I have learned a lot in my career from being there at the beginning of projects, their early implementation, their smooth operation phase, and to the point of removal. I have seen my code find great success and make game-changing effects for the customers of the product. I have also seen my solution crash and burn and have to be part of the rescue effort. These experiences of end-to-end experiences with failures have been particularly educational to me. Everyone should cherish the failures and not be afraid of doing something that may fail (although, obviously, you should not seek to fail).

## Be willing to specialize but don't die on the hill of a failing technology

This may seem at odds with the previous suggestion of focusing on core principles but find a specialty that you can dig deep on and become an expert in. This will not be something that you do on day one of your career but as time goes on and you try a breadth of different things find what you like and are good at. Once you find this thing dig in deep. Become an expert in that thing. This will make you a much bigger asset to whatever you work on and set you apart from those around you. More than just frontend or backend work focus on something more specific. Maybe you are good at React or NodeJS. Maybe you become an expert in ElasticSearch or Kafka. You shouldn't just go deep in one thing but you also shouldn't try to specialize in everything. If one element of your expertise is in a particular technology it is important to understand what it is good for and what it is not good for. Too many times we see people use the tool that they are an expert in for all problems. This gets back to the proverbial "if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail".

My company once was using a product to solve a particular problem. After explaining what we were doing he responded with, "I hope you don't feel like we are wasting your time but our tool is not the right way to solve that problem." Even with all the incentives stacked in the favor of trying to get us to use their product he still went against it and suggested we look elsewhere. My trust in what he said immediately increased.

The other side of specializing is understanding when your particular technology or expertise falls out of style. Because you are following the previous topic about having a solid foundation in the core principles you are well prepared to pivot when this happens. If your expertise was COBOL programming there are still jobs out there for you but your options are more limited than if you specialized in Java. I have seen too many people pigeonhole themselves into one technology and when they leave a particular job they can't find their next place and obsolete themselves.

There are many things we can do to grow our careers. Not everyone's path will be the same. The above suggestions are just suggestions. The core principles behind them are solid though. Always be learning, push yourself out of your comfort zone, learn from those around you, offer to help those around you, and reap the benefits.
