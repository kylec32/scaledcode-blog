It is human nature to stay within our comfort zones. There is a reason "comfort" is in the name. That being said, it is no secret that very little learning is accomplished while staying in your comfort zone, and if there is anything we know about technology it is that it is constantly changing. Taking this to heart there are various methods you can go about leaving your comfort zone. So how do you choose how to leave your comfort zone and try different technologies?

A first step may be to decide why you are trying to get out of your comfort zone, what is the goal? If the goal is to stay open to new processes and technologies you may choose to mix in new technologies in low-risk places one at a time. This method can be particularly useful when comparing different technologies. This is much closer to a scientific way of going about it, change one variable and compare and contrast its effects on outcomes. There is a place for this method and I think it is one that we should all constantly be keeping this method in mind. That said, what I want to focus on today is a less scientific method, one where the goal is simply learning for learning's sake without a specific goal in mind. This method is where you choose completely different technologies to use and completely step out of your comfort zone.

The specifics of what this looks like will be different for everyone. Potentially you are a Python developer, this may mean you try picking up and learning some about Rust. See what a strong type system feels like. Or maybe you have never tried functional programming and you give that a try. This definitely can extend to more than programming languages. Try new data stores, programming patterns, message queues, deployment systems, etc. You never know, you might find something better than what you are currently using.

The best and most fruitful part of this practice is not in finding tooling that replaces your current tooling. Although this can happen it is less likely to happen in my experience. What can happen much more often is that a new/different way of thinking can be introduced by using the other technology and you can bring that learning into your day-to-day work. It also can be extremely useful in having a basic understanding of many tools and techniques to have in your toolbelt. You may not use it often (or even ever) but the odds of you knowing it is the right tool for the job greatly decreases if you have zero experience with a particular tool.

As you learn these other technologies it is very useful to learn both the reasons someone would use that technology and why they wouldn't. We often seek out information to confirm our current beliefs when it is often more informative to seek out information that contradicts our current views. It doesn't mean you need to buy into the contrary belief but having at least a familiarity can help you avoid pitfalls. Perhaps you use Java and love it. Go out and seek, "Why not use Java?". Maybe you see no reason to use anything other than a relational database, seek out why people choose NoSQL.
The technology industry is one of constant learning. You can either take ownership of your learning or be forced into playing catch-up. It likely comes as no surprise that having control of your learning will have much better payback. Taking the method of choosing to challenge your experiences and trying something new can pay off many dividends.
