Many times the question has been asked, [should](https://www.infoq.com/articles/architects-should-code-bryson) [software](http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/should-architects-code/) [architects](https://dev.to/rmorschel/should-architects-code) [code](https://www.ahmadnassri.com/blog/what-is-a-software-architect-and-should-they-write-code/)? Or, can they code or should they focus elsewhere? Often the role in general of the software architect is somewhat in flux. The core duties being a techincal leader, guiding the technical direction of the organization, interacting with the business in such a way to be able to determine and represent the [quality attributes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee658094.aspx) of the system. Outside of this, at least in my experience, the role feels many roles: technical PO, firefighter, spelunker. This is often a topic of discussion for me and my coworkers and I suspect we will never come to a consensus on all the details. But should/can they code? 

It's accepted that software architects need to know how to code, often this is exactly how they get promoted to the software architect role, by being a great developer. But, much like the management track, does a promotion to an architect position mean a retirement from code. As a person that has an architect role I sure hope not but I can see how that would be the case. Developing is my passion, it's what I signed up for. A professional life without being active in the actual development of features to provide value to customers is a sad one. At the same time I love working at the architectural level.  Making trade-off decisions, investigating new technologies, helping lead the architectural direction of the system all are very enjoyable for me.

This particular issue has been weighing on my mind particularly today as one of my teammates on the architecture team announced that he was stepping away from the architecture team in favor of working on a feature team. The reasons he mentioned all resonated with me. Things such as: wanting to write more code, having a problem and finding a solution, seeing tasks to completion (not just setting the stage), being able to make final decisions on things instead of just suggestions. He is a strong member of our team and we will be missing a large amount of knowledge without him. Part of me was very jealous of his decision (a decision I could make for myself but, for the reasons stated above, can't bring myself to). I have ached to write more code. Recently my team has taken a particularly hairy task which we likely should have handed to a feature team but I think we have all missed coding some much we somewhat broke process and took it for ourselves. I have signed up for a site called [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/) that gives me me reports every week about how much I have been coding. I have had weeks where the number was 1 hour whereas when my role was as a software developer I could easily have 35+ hour weeks. 

If I had it my way I would definitely be more involved in coding. There is definitely something to be said about emergent architecture and I feel like I could contribute there. It is the classic problem of wanting the best of both worlds. Who knows what the future will bring, maybe I will transition back to the software engineer role. I never want to become disconnected from the code and the depth of knowledge that comes from working at that level while at the same time the breadth of knowledge and the systems view that you get at the architect level also makes me a better coder. 

This has mostly turned into rambling on the ideas that I have about the problems of juggling the duties of the architect with the duties of an architect.
