Imposter syndrome can affect anyone. It can affect a new parent or a seasoned veteran in a particular field. While some people and some situations lend themselves to imposter syndrome more than others, no one is immune. Often imposter syndrome is discussed as a negative thing that can stifle people and paralyze them. This is indeed true. I, however, would like to dig into it to see what benefits we can pull out of situations where we feel imposter syndrome.

I liken imposter syndrome to stress. In reality, it seems to often present itself as stress in our lives anyway. Stress, especially at levels that seem all too common now, is no doubt harmful. It can lead to depression, physical illnesses, and other negative impacts. There are, however, ways that stress can be used to our advantage. While the fight or flight response baked into our reptilian brain likely isn't needed in our modern lives (if it is you are living a much more exciting life than me), that same biological response can be used to help increases your focus, give you the extra boost of energy to accomplish a task, and help us succeed in what we are doing. In the same way, feelings of being an imposter can also be indicative of good things.

One benefit that can be recognized by recognizing imposter syndrome is that it likely means we are pushing ourselves. If you feel like the dumbest person in the room at a new job, guess what, you might just be in a lot of things but you are there for a reason. Embrace being the new person. Embrace the opportunity to dig deep into something you don't know. Don't let the feeling of being an imposter stop you from progressing out of that level of misunderstanding. There is a good chance that you aren't the only one that doesn't know something. Also of note, if you aren't the new person and a new person offers a question that you don't know the answer to (especially if you are a person in leadership) add that commentary. It can defuse a person's feelings of inadequacy. Don't lie and say you don't know things you actually do, but also don't hide that you don't know something when you might be expected to.

Imposter syndrome also leads to being on the humble side of the pride continuum. You are likely too far on the humble side but relationships don't seem to be as negatively affected by those being overly humble versus those that are prideful jerks. As you work to overcome your feelings of inadequacy you will be pushing yourself towards the prideful side of the continuum. The hope is to stop when you get to being proud of your work and being able to express that healthily.

The final ability to take advantage of when plagued with imposter thoughts is that it helps you with empathy. When we realize we don't know everything we are forced to compensate in other ways. One of those ways can be to be more empathetic and recognize those around you with similar thoughts. Whether it is now or later, basically everyone will be affected by these thoughts. This can be a comforting thought and one that can allow us to reach out and help each other along the way.

Imposter syndrome and related feelings can overwhelm you without a doubt. Taken as a whole I think it is a net negative. That said, we don't choose these feelings. Thus, when we are afflicted by them any way I think it would be foolish to not recognize and embrace the good things that come with the bad including imposter syndrome. As we focus on the positives and highlight the effect they are making on us I believe we can minimize the debilitating parts of imposter syndrome that all too often are the star (or villain) of the show.
