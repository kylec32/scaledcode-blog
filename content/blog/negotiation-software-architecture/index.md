I was recently listening to the book [Never Split the Difference](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Split-Difference-Negotiating-Depended-ebook/dp/B014DUR7L2). In this book a former FBI hostage negotiator, Chris Voss, goes through some lessons learned and stories from his career and how they can be applied to negotiations in business and in life. As I listened to the stories and the principles he shared I had two thoughts: 
1. I am definitely not cut out for hostage negotiation.
2. Turns out negotiation is more of my job than I had originally thought. 

As I have discussed in previous posts there are competing ideas of preparing features and solutions for the rest of the organization at the risk of becoming an [ivory architect](http://www.gitshah.com/2011/01/ivory-tower-architect.html) vs leaving everything up to developers to the point where your job is basically useless. Obviously the goldilocks of this would be somewhere in the middle of these two extremes. In order to effectively live in that middle ground you need to work closely with developers and the other people implementing the features. Technical people of all sorts often want to design things from the ground up, have their own ideas in mind, and can be stubborn. 

The greatest solutions are those where both the system as a whole is considered as well as the understanding of what is actually happening in the code is considered. Never Split the Difference talks about how the algorithmic methods of negotiation are ineffective. Especially as software people, we would love a formula for dealing with people but unfortunately that is not the case. Even though this book does not give us a strict formula it does give us some guidelines of things to try and keep in mind when working on a problem with differing opinions. 

### Most people approach a negotiation so preoccupied by the arguments that support their position that they are unable to listen attentively
This is a very easy pitfall to fall into. We are looking for solutions. We love to come up with these solutions. That being said, great solutions can come from anywhere. Anywhere includes not just from you (gasp, I know). So simply put, _listen, then respond_ not _prepare your response and ignore what others are saying_. We begin with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety to begin a real conversation.

### The fastest and most efficient way of establishing a quick working relationship is to acknowledge the negative and diffuse it.

It may sound somewhat strange but I like applying this idea when pitching an idea. By pointing out the downsides (there are always downsides) you take the wind out of your critics sails and instead can guide the discussion into if the trade-offs are worth it. It also makes the person you are talking to more comfortable poking additional holes as you have already started the process. It also can show humility to others in that you know that you don't have perfect solutions and are working alongside them. 

### When your adversaries say "that's right," they feel they have assessed what you've said and pronounced it as correct of their own free will. They embrace it.

This has been the root of something that has been particularly hard for me. Not that I always want the credit however it can be hard to see others get the accolades for something you designed. That being said, being a one-man-band will never be scalable and is definitely not scalable. As is clearly explained in this book the awkwardness and tension between parties can be erased in making the other party not realize you are the one feeding them the thoughts.

There is a lot more to the book and I would highly suggest it. Negotiating in software is not about being the winner or loser. It's about melding of ideas. It's about bringing value to users. It's about meeting the needs of the users.
